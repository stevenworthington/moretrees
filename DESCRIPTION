Description: Provides functions for implementingmulti-outcome regression
    tree-structured shrinkage with a spike-and-slab prior (ssMOReTreeS).
    Three different likelihoods corresponding to different generalized
    linear models are available: binary with logistic link, Poisson with
    log link, and Gaussian with identity link. Models are fit using
    variational inference (VI). Also performs spike-and-slab variable
    selection with the same three likelihoods.
